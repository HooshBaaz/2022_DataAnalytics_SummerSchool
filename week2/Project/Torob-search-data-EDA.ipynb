    "\n",
    "Greetings and a warm welcome from Torob Data Team!\n",
    "\n",
    "We are very excited to share with you the Torob's search data for the task of exploratory data analysis as part of OpenAI Summer School 2022. The data consists of users' search logs as well as their clicks on search results in Torob. It also includes information for a sample of the products and product categories. In this notebook, you will analyze this data and answer some questions with the goal of practicing your data analysis skills (especially the ability to work with Pandas) and also extract insightful information from our users' searches and their interaction with the search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that our original daily search data is very large (you may need gigabytes of RAM and disk space to handle the data of just one day!). So, for practical purposes and due to the size constraints, the original data has been sampled and reduced, and what you'll work with is just a small fraction of the data of one week. \n",
    "\n",
    "The sections marked with a triangular flag (ðŸš©) are those which you need to read and answer. Allright, without further ado let's get started!\n",
    "\n",

Welcome to the repo for the 2022 Data Analytics Summer School at the University of Tehran.

This course has been compiled with the aim of providing basic and practical training for different concepts and methods of data analysis. During this course, the most prominent Iranian professors of artificial intelligence and data analysis inside and outside Iran participate in order to provide the best quality of education for students.

hands-on training sessions are held continuously throughout the course. In these classes, practical projects based on real problems and challenges are proposed by prominent computer companies "Tapsel", "Fidibo" and "Tapsi" and the students solve these challenges with the help of personal \textit{Mentors}. Finally, the distinguished graduates of this course will be introduced to our partner companies in the industry for job interviews.

Graduates who get a passing grade in the course will be issued an official certificate by the University of Tehran. These graduates can participate in more advanced courses held by \textbf{HushBaz} in the future.

- Project 2: Torob
- Project 3: To be announced


## Class structure

Each day has 2 slots, one happening in the morning, from 9AM to 12:15AM, the other happening in the afternoon, from 1:30PM to 4:45PM. Each slot starts with a theoretical session in the lecture halls lasting 1:30 hours, followed by a workshop session after a 15 minute break. 

There are 3 projects in the course of this SummerSchool, each a week

## Theoretical Sessions

During the theoretical sessions, the education material of the subjects specified will be taught by top faculties and researchers of Data Analytics and AI inside and outside Iran. These sessions are held as keynote presentations. Since the HandsOn workshops followed by these theoretical sessions will directly be related to them, and hence impossible to do without knowing the theory, it is important to be on time during these classes. Theoretical sessions are held in Electrical and Computer Faculty of Tehran University, Lecture Halls, Hall 2.

## HandsOn workshops

During the HandsOn workshops, you apply your gained theoretical knowledge and work on practical problems. You also get to connect with others and do networking. Please note that no question is a stupid question, so never feel discouraged to ask questions from others. Also be supportive of others and try to answer their questions. Afterall, asking questions is the way to detect our weakpoints and turn them into strong points! During these sessions, the mentors are there to help you, so use them to your advantage! Or just to chat! If you manage to finish all the HandsOn problems, please tell one of the mentors. They will introduce you to the Professors and they will personally divise for you even more challanging material to work on! If you have extra time, spend it on getting to know others, helping them, and networking. Ask your mentors to review your codes.

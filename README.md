</h1>
</p>

<br clear="left"/>

<hr style="border:2px solid gray">

Welcome to the repo for the 2022 Data Analytics Summer School at the University of Tehran.
This course has been compiled with the aim of providing basic and practical training for different concepts and methods of data analysis. During this course, the most prominent Iranian professors of AI and Data Analysis inside and outside Iran participate in order to provide the best quality of education for students.

Moreover, Hands-On training sessions are held continuously throughout the course and practical projects based on real problems and challenges are proposed by prominent computer companies "Tapsel", "Fidibo" and "Tapsi". The students solve these challenges with the help of personal Mentors. Finally, the distinguished graduates of this course will be introduced to our partner companies in the industry for job interviews.

Graduates who get a passing grade in the course will be issued an official certificate by the University of Tehran. These graduates can participate in more advanced courses held by <strong>HooshBaaz</strong> in the future.

## Course Structure

The course happens on Thursdays and Fridays on 4 consecutive weeks. Each day has 2 slots, one happening in the morning, from 9AM to 12:15AM, the other happening in the afternoon, from 1:30PM to 4:45PM. Each slot starts with a Theoretical Session in the lecture halls lasting 1:30 hours, followed by a Hands-On Workshop after a 15 minute break. There are 3 projects over the course of this Summer-School, each happening on the weekdays between the weekends.

<!--Your participation is keyThis is an introductory course this course may take a lot of your time-->

### Theoretical Sessions

During the Theoretical Sessions, the education material of the subjects specified will be taught by top professors and researchers of AI and Data Analytics inside and outside Iran. Since the Hands-On Workshops are directly related to their preceding Theoretical Session, they might become harder to follow without knowing the theory. Hence, it is important to be on time during the Tehoretical Sessions. Note that the last day of HooshBaaz will contain 4 Theoretical Sessions and there will be no Hands-On Workshops. The Theoretical Sessions are held in the Electrical and Computer Faculty of the University of Tehran, Lecture Halls, Hall 2.

- The Theory sessions materials are partially available in the folder of their corresponding weeks.

### Hands-On workshops

During the Hands-On workshops, you will apply your gained theoretical knowledge on practical problems. You also get to connect with others and do networking. During these sessions, the mentors are there to assist you with your queries, so use them to your advantage! If you don't have questions, still ask your mentors to review your codes. If you manage to finish all the Hands-On problems, please tell one of the Mentors; They will introduce you to the Professor present in HooshBaaz that day and they will personally divise for you even more challanging material to work on! If you find extra time or just want to rest a little, you can spend it on getting to know others, helping them, and networking. Please note that no question is a stupid question, so never feel discouraged to ask questions from the Mentors and even other students. Also be supportive of others and try to answer their questions if you can. Afterall, asking questions is the way to detect weakpoints and turn them into strong-points! You can find the Hands-On material for each week in the corresponding week's folder. These files are in the form of Python Notebooks.

- The Hands-On materials are available in the folder of their corresponding weeks.

### Projects

<!-- Real data from real companies! The response, OBSstudio, deadlines -->
There is a project from real companies with real data for each week. You should work on these projects on your own during the week and submit them via Telegram by the end of the week. Note that the large files belonging to your projects are not available in Git (e.g. videos, data), but the questions and the solutions are available here. The full project data is shared with you via Telegram. 

- Project 1: [Taxi data analysis](week1/Project)
- Project 2: [Torob EDA](week2/Project)
- Project 3: (To be announced)

- The Project materials are partially available in the folder of their corresponding weeks (Only the small files).
